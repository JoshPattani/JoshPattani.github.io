# Garbage Odyssey - An Atari Asteroids Remix

## About

This is a remix of the classic Atari Asteroids game. It was created as a final project for the ATLS2200 - Web course.

(This is game is current a work in progress.)

## How to Play

The game is simple. Use the arrow keys to move your ship around the screen (arrow down has no function). Use the spacebar to shoot. Shoot the asteroids and enemies to destroy them. If you get hit by an asteroid or enemy, you lose a life. If you lose all your lives, you lose the game.
There is a random chance of spawning a powerup item when an asteroid is destroyed. The powerup item will give you sustained fire power for a short amount of time. If you destroy all the asteroids, you win the game.
